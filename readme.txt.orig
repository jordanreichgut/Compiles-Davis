COMPILES DAVIS
15-112 Term Project by Jordan Reichgut
Carnegie Mellon University
Spring 2017

<<<<<<< HEAD
Compiles Davis is a tool for jazz musicians that simulates improvisation. It randomly generates, prints out, and plays back melodies over chord changes. The user can either choose from a list of 20 jazz standards with pre-programmed changes or manually input the chords.

The sheet music opens in MuseScore, an open source music composition tool. Within MuseScore, the user can play back, edit, and save the music as a PDF.

Compiles Davis utilizes Music21, an open source Python module developed by MIT, as well as the standard Tkinter library. Music21 installation instructions can be found here: http://web.mit.edu/music21/.

Compiles Davis requires MuseScore and Music21 to be installed in order to run properly. The “music21” master folder must be in the same directory as CompilesDavis.py.

To use the program, run CompilesDavis.py.

DESIGN

Compiles Davis is targeted toward jazz musicians. It helps them expand their vocabulary by generating “licks” (musical phrases). Plagiarism is common in jazz, and musicians copy each other all the time. Anyone who uses this tool is encouraged to incorporate the music it generates in his/her playing.

This was an original idea. There are similar tools that exist, but none were inspiration for this project. Compiles Davis combines my passions of jazz and coding with a practical tool that can be improved in the future.
